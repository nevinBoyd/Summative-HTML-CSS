        <h2>The Cuts...</h2>
        <p>
            I've done everything just about once, almost everything at least.
            I spent the last 11 - 12 years as a Machinist. I am a Family type of dude.
            I swinging a Zweih√§nder while preparing my Innvocation's of Firaga IV,
            Immolating goblins that stand in the path of... Dinner Time.
            I'm eclectic, catch me on a proper day to bloviate nonsense,
            much like trying to Decipher Lorem IPSOMs.... I'll spare you the x7 on that though
            I was debating on using in this section. Just Kidding.
            There is much more about me, and I should have probably kept it professional,
            but like I said I was a Machinist for the last 11-12 years. I'll work on it. ^^
